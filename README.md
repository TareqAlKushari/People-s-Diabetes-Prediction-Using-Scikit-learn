# People's Diabetes Prediction Using Scikit-learn

This project showcases a machine learning approach to **predicting whether a person is likely to have diabetes** based on medical diagnostic measurements. It uses the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset** and applies various preprocessing and classification techniques using **Scikit-learn**.

## 🧠 Project Goal

The goal is to train a predictive model that can determine the presence of diabetes from health-related features like glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, and age using supervised learning algorithms.
